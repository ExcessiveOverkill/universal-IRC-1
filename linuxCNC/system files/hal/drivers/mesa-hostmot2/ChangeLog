    hm 0.15 

    Fixed a system crash bug in pwmgen.

    All stepgen step_types are now supported.  stepgen velocity-fb now
    reports the commanded step rate, not the estimated.  Fixed some
    stepgen bugs.

    Better logging - now doesnt need the RTAPI debug level tweaked to
    show the useful stuff.

    Much better encoder support.  Index, Index mask, velocity estimation.

    Renamed GPIO HAL objects to make more sense.  Better logging of
    actual pin usage at driver load time.

    New firmware files from Peter Wallace.

    Misc minor cleanups here and there.


released 2008-10-28
    hm2_pci 0.6

    Added support for the 5i23 and 4i68.  All the PCI, PC-104/Plus,
    and EPP Anything I/O boards are now supported.  :-)


released 2008-10-27
    hm2_pci 0.5

    Added support for the 5i22.  hm2_pci replaces hm2_5i20.

    The 5i22-1.0 board is tested and seems to be working fine.  The 5i22-1.5
    hasnt been tested yet.


released 2008-10-05
    hm2 0.14

    Added support for PDM mode to the pwmgen driver.  Renamed pwmgen.frequency
    to pwmgen.pwm_frequency; added pwmgen.pdm_frequency.

    pwmgen now zeroes the output pins (PWM & Dir, or PDM & Dir, or UP & Down
    depending on output-type) when the .enable HAL pin is low.

    Added support for the final pwmgen mode: PWM & Dir with outputs swapped,
    for locked antiphase.  .output-type=4


released 2008-09-22
    hm2 0.13

    Fixed a cut-n-paste error that could make pwmgens not work properly.

    Added a pwmgen.frequency parameter, which lets the user control the
    pwmgen frequency from about 1 Hz up to about 193 KHz (on the 5i20
    and 7i43).  Also added pwmgen.bits, a read-only parameter showing
    number of bits of resolution of the pwmgen duty cycle.


released 2008-09-20
    hm2 0.12

    Fixed a bug in stepgen: negative values for .position_scale now work.
    Thanks to Eric Johnson for discovering, reporting, and helping to
    debug this.

    Fixed a bug in in pwmgen: negative values for .scale now work.

    Cleaned up encoder driver some.  Added new encoder features to
    manpage.

    Now accepts stepgen.maxaccel = 0, which means "don't limit
    acceleration at all".

    Switched to the latest firmware VHDL source code from Peter Wallace
    at Mesa Electronics.


released 2008-09-14
    hm2_5i20 0.4

    Add support for the 4i65 Anything I/O board (in the now mis-named
    hm2_5i20 driver).  The 4i65 just like the 5i20, except the PCI
    Subsystem Device ID is different and the first I/O connector is
    named P1 instead of P2.


released 2008-09-11
    hostmot2 0.11

    This fixes a bug in pwmgen so that .scale works as expected.


released 2008-08-22
    hostmot2 0.10

    Added stepgen.maxaccel.

    This version of the stepgen position controller and velocity slewing
    code is the least broken one yet.

    Added stepgen.velocity_cmd (not writable, just for peeking at what
    the velocity slewing code is doing).


released 2008-08-21
    hostmot2 0.9

    Fixed stepgen.stepspace, it was not getting set correctly on the FPGA.

    Fixed stepgen.position-fb, it was not getting set reported correctly
    to HAL.

    Added stepgen.maxvel.

    Added raw.dump_state, a way to cause hostmot2 to dump its internal
    state to the syslog.


released 2008-08-19
    hostmot2 0.8

    Changed the stepgen timing parameters from "float seconds" to
    "u32 nanoseconds".  This breaks existing configs that use stepgen!

    Added an "enable" pin for stepgen.

    Fixed a harmless buglet in the Master DDS stepgen fix that went
    into 0.6.

    Segregated the stepgen debug pins to make things clearer.


released 2008-08-17
    hostmot2 0.7

    Give HAL interfaces to all IO pins, not just the full GPIOs.  IO pins
    used by active module instances have restricted interfaces.

    Improved IO Port handling.  Support open-drain pins.

    Updated README to reflect reality.

    Report firmware timestamp when loading.

    Improved config string parsing.


released 2008-08-15
    hostmot2 0.6

    Fix a bug in the stepgen driver.  Stepgen now works on both the 5i20
    and the 7i43.


released 2008-08-13
    hostmot2 0.5
    hm2_5i20 0.3

    The llios now export a "threadsafe" flag.  If it's set, hostmot2
    exports an additional pair of functions to read & write just the
    gpios.  The 5i20 supports this, but the 7i43 does not.

    5i20: mark driver as threadsafe.


0.4 (released 2008-08-03)

    Moved firmware loading from userspace to the kernel.  The low-level
    I/O drivers (hm2_5i20 & hm2_7i43) register a "program_fpga()"
    function with the hostmot2 driver, and request a firmware file in
    their config string.  The hostmot2 driver fetches the firmware with
    request_firmware()/udev, validates the bitfile, and feeds it to the
    llio's program_fpga() function.

    hm2_5i20 and hm2_7i43 now supply a program_fpga() function, used by
    the high-level firmware driver to program them when they register.

    hm2_5i20:

	Improved board-detection-time error handling.

	Added the LASxBRD #READY fix from bfload.

    hm2_7i43:

	Now detects the board's FPGA (needed for firmware programming).


0.3 (released 2008-06-17)

    Added support for Raw mode (lets you peek & poke the hostmot2 firmware
    from HAL).


0.2 (released 2008-05-25)

    Improved load-time sanity checking.

    Improved handling of "zero instances enabled" situations.


0.1 (released 2008-05-13)

    Split m7i43_hm2 0.4 into a generic hostmot2 driver and a low-level I/O
    driver for the 7i43 (called hm2_7i43).  Moved the firmware loading
    on the 7i43 from the kernel driver to userspace, by extending the
    bfload program.

    Wrote a new driver that plugs the 5i20 board into the hostmot2 driver.
    Firmware loading on the 5i20 was already supported by bfload.
