component clarke2 "Two input version of Clarke transform";
description """The Clarke transform can be used to translate a vector
quantity from a three phase system (three components 120 degrees
apart) to a two phase Cartesian system.\n.P\n\\fBclarke2\\fR implements
a special case of the Clarke transform, which only needs two of the
three input phases.  In a three wire three phase system, the sum of the
three phase currents or voltages must always be zero.  As a result only
two of the three are needed to completely define the current or voltage.
\\fBclarke2\\fR assumes that the sum is zero, so it only uses phases A and
B of the input.  Since the H (homopolar) output will always be zero in
this case, it is not generated.""";
see_also """\\fBclarke3\\fR for the general case, \\fBclarkeinv\\fR for
the inverse transform.""";
