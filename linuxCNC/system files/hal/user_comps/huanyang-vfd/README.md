linuxcnc-huanyang-vfd
=====================

A user space component for controlling a huanyang spindle inverter with linuxcnc.
The component was developed by S. Alford and published at http://www.cnczone.com/forums/phase-converters/91847-huanyang-vfd-rs485-modbus-3.html#post704008http://www.cnczone.com/forums/phase-converters/91847-huanyang-vfd-rs485-modbus-3.html#post704008
Some changes were contributed to fix problems with the rebranding of emc2 to linuxcnc.
These were contributed by alan_3301, also on the forum.

I myself have included some minor bugfixes in the code.

The software is released under GPL V2
